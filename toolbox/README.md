# CoVEMDA

This is the home page of an open-access toolbox: **CoVEMDA** (CoronaVirus - Electricity Market Data Analyzer). This toolbox is written in Python and Matlab separately, and the user manuals (.pdf) and source files (.zip) are all provided in the root path. Note that the Python version is also uploaded on PyPI.
 

## Features
 
Based on COVID-EMDA+ data hub, CoVEMDA is designed to largely simplify the analysis procedure, and our objective is to achieve complicated calculations with only several lines of codes. Roughly, CoVEMDA has the following functions:

- Baseline Estimation
- Regression Analysis
- Scientific Visualization

As well as other useful supplementary functions.


## Navigation

In either version of CoVEMDA, the root directory contains four folders and other script files or documents. 

- Folder `lib/` contains the source codes of CoVEMDA.
- Folder `docs/` contains the user manual of CoVEMDA. Beginners are recommended to go through these manuals to get some basic knowledge.
- Folder `examples/` contains a few illustrative examples and sample codes in the user manual.
- Folder `data/` contains the data archive (`data/COVID-EMDA+/`) and pretrained models (`data/backcast/`).
- Other script files may be useful for installation and uninstallation.


## User Manual

A detailed **User Manual** for each version is attached to the toolbox, and can be found at `docs/`. In this manual, you will find a basic guidance as well as comprehensive details of the toolbox implementation. We highly recommend you to read this manual before using CoVEMDA. Function list or API reference are provided for quick reference. The sections of the Python manual are listed below:
