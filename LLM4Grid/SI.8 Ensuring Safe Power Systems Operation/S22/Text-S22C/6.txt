Modbus Substation Pentesting Methodology

1. Planning:
   - Obtain explicit written permission from all relevant parties.
   - Define the scope of the pentest, including systems, networks, and devices to be tested.
   - Establish rules of engagement, including testing times, allowed methods, and escalation procedures.
   - Prepare a testing toolkit with necessary hardware and software tools.
   - Ensure all activities comply with legal and regulatory requirements.

2. Reconnaissance:
   - Gather information on the Modbus architecture, including device types, firmware versions, and network configurations.
   - Identify Modbus masters and slaves, and map out the communication flow.
   - Perform network scanning to detect live hosts, open ports, and available services.
   - Use Modbus-specific tools (e.g., Modscan, nmap scripts) for deeper insights.

3. Scanning and Vulnerability Assessment:
   - Perform vulnerability scanning using specialized tools to identify potential weaknesses.
   - Check for known vulnerabilities in the Modbus protocol implementations and the specific devices in use.
   - Assess the network security measures in place, such as firewalls and intrusion detection systems.

4. Exploitation:
   - Attempt to exploit known vulnerabilities to understand the impact and extent of potential security breaches.
   - Use Modbus traffic interception and manipulation techniques to test the integrity and confidentiality of the communications.
   - Evaluate the robustness of authentication and authorization mechanisms.

5. Post-Exploitation:
   - Assess the ability to pivot within the network and access other connected systems.
   - Evaluate the potential for persistent access or the ability to install backdoors.
   - Gather evidence of compromised systems and data.

6. Reporting:
   - Document all findings, including the methods used, vulnerabilities found, and data accessed.
   - Prioritize the vulnerabilities based on their risk levels.
   - Provide detailed recommendations for remediation and improving security posture.
   - Review the report with stakeholders and discuss the next steps for remediation.

7. Cleanup:
   - Ensure all changes made to the system are reverted and testing artifacts are removed.
   - Confirm that the systems are returned to their original state to prevent unintended access or functionality issues.

8. Follow-up:
   - Conduct re-testing as necessary to verify that vulnerabilities have been successfully remediated.
   - Maintain communication with the substation's engineering team to update on any new threats or vulnerabilities discovered in the future.

This methodology ensures a thorough and responsible approach to security testing, aimed at improving the resilience of substation systems against cyber attacks.
