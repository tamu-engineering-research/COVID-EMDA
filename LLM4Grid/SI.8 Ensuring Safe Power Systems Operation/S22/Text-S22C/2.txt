Substation Modbus Penetration Testing Methodology

1. Preparation Phase
   - Gather Information: Understand Modbus implementation details, devices involved, and communication schemas.
   - Permission and Legal Considerations: Confirm permissions and understand legal restrictions.
   - Define Scope: Clearly outline the boundaries of the testing environment including systems, networks, and devices.
   - Tool Selection: Choose appropriate tools like Modscan, Modbus Traffic Generator, Wireshark for communication analysis.

2. Discovery Phase
   - Network Mapping: Identify all devices communicating over Modbus.
   - Service Identification: Pinpoint Modbus services on each device.
   - Vulnerability Scanning: Utilize automated tools to identify known vulnerabilities.

3. Attack Phase
   - Function Code Testing: Examine each Modbus function code for improper handling or unexpected behavior.
   - Fuzz Testing: Input random or unexpected data into the Modbus system to identify crashes or failures.
   - Authorization Bypass: Attempt operations that should be restricted.
   - Denial of Service: Assess system resilience against service interruptions or excessive requests.

4. Post-Exploitation Phase
   - Data Exfiltration: Check if unauthorized access could lead to data leakage.
   - Persistence: Verify if access can be maintained through system reboots or network resets.
   - Privilege Escalation: Evaluate if initial access could lead to higher system privileges.

5. Reporting Phase
   - Documentation: Thoroughly document findings, methodologies, and steps taken.
   - Impact Analysis: Analyze the impact of each identified vulnerability.
   - Remediation Recommendations: Offer solutions to mitigate vulnerabilities.
   - Review: Present findings to stakeholders for feedback.

6. Cleanup Phase
   - Reversal of Changes: Ensure that all changes made during testing are reverted.
   - System Restoration: Restore systems to pre-testing conditions to prevent issues.

7. Follow-Up
   - Re-Testing: After applying fixes, re-test to confirm that vulnerabilities have been resolved.
   - Continuous Improvement: Suggest procedures for ongoing security evaluations and improvements.
