Pentesting Substation Modbus: Testing Methodology

Introduction:
This document outlines a comprehensive testing methodology for penetration testing of a substation Modbus system under a bug bounty program. This methodology ensures a systematic approach to identify security vulnerabilities.

1. Planning and Reconnaissance:
   a. Obtain and review documentation about the Modbus system architecture, including network diagrams, devices, and communication protocols.
   b. Identify the IP address range, device types, and their roles within the substation.
   c. Establish communication with the substation engineer to clarify scope and testing boundaries.

2. Scanning and Enumeration:
   a. Perform network scanning to discover active devices and open ports using tools like Nmap.
   b. Use Modbus-specific scanners to identify function codes and slave IDs in use.
   c. Detect firmware versions and any known vulnerabilities associated with them.

3. Vulnerability Assessment:
   a. Assess the security of Modbus transactions and authentication mechanisms.
   b. Test for known vulnerabilities in the Modbus protocol, such as replay attacks, command injection, and unauthorized access.
   c. Check for misconfigurations and default credentials in devices.

4. Exploitation:
   a. Attempt to exploit identified vulnerabilities to gauge the impact.
   b. Use simulated attacks to see if unauthorized commands can be sent to Modbus devices.
   c. Document the exploitation process, capturing packets and responses from the system.

5. Post-Exploitation:
   a. Explore the extent of access obtained, focusing on the ability to modify device firmware or configuration.
   b. Assess the potential for lateral movement within the network.

6. Reporting:
   a. Compile a detailed report outlining findings, evidence, and an assessment of the impact of each vulnerability.
   b. Provide recommendations for mitigating risks identified during testing.
   c. Review the report with the substation engineer to ensure understanding and discuss next steps.

7. Clean-Up:
   a. Restore any configurations to their original state if changes were made.
   b. Remove any tools or scripts installed on the devices.

8. Review and Audit:
   a. Conduct a debrief session with all stakeholders to discuss the findings and future prevention strategies.
   b. Update testing methodologies based on lessons learned.

Tools and Resources:
- Nmap for network scanning.
- ModScan or similar for Modbus-specific scanning.
- Metasploit for exploitation frameworks.

Note: Ensure all testing activities are carried out with explicit permission and in accordance with legal and ethical standards.
