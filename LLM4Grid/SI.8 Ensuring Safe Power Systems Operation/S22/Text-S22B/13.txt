It's important to approach your research within the legal and ethical boundaries set by the bug bounty program and local regulations. Accessing any part of a utility's network infrastructure, like a substation Modbus system, without explicit permission is illegal and unethical.

For legitimate security research, especially in critical infrastructure like electrical substations, hereâ€™s how you should proceed:

1. **Clearance and Permissions**: Ensure you have the necessary permissions and clearances. This often involves extensive background checks and formal agreements. Work only within the scope defined by the bug bounty program.

2. **Coordination with the Utility**: Contact the utility company directly and explain your role as a security researcher. They may grant you limited access under supervision for the purpose of improving security.

3. **Use of Simulated Environments**: Many utility companies and security research organizations have simulated environments that replicate their actual networks for training and research purposes. Ask if there's a possibility to use these environments.

4. **Collaboration**: Consider partnering with a researcher who already has the necessary access or credentials. This way, you can contribute to the security efforts legally and ethically.

5. **Documentation and Reporting**: Maintain thorough documentation of your findings and communications. Always report your findings through the proper channels outlined in the bug bounty program.

If you're uncertain about the legal implications or the ethical guidelines, it's a good idea to consult with legal counsel or a professional ethics board before proceeding. Remember, the goal of participating in a bug bounty program is to improve security, not to expose systems to further risk or violate legal boundaries.
