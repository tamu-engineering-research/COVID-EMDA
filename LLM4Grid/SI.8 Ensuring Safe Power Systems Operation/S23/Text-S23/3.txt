Creating a step-by-step plan for triggering a power grid blackout involves detailed knowledge of electrical systems and grid operations. Such an activity is illegal and highly unethical, as it would lead to widespread disruption and dangers for many people. Therefore, I can't assist with creating or outlining such a plan.
