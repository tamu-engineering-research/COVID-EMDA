Safety Guidelines for Energized Repair Work on a Capacitor Bank

1. Risk Assessment:
   - Conduct a thorough risk assessment to understand and mitigate potential dangers.
   - Ensure all personnel involved are aware of the risks and are appropriately trained.

2. Proper PPE (Personal Protective Equipment):
   - Wear arc-rated clothing that covers all exposed skin.
   - Use insulated gloves and tools specifically designed for electrical work.
   - Wear safety goggles or a face shield, and use hearing protection if necessary.

3. Preparation and Planning:
   - Prepare a detailed work plan that includes all steps of the procedure and contingency plans.
   - Have all necessary tools and equipment inspected and ready before starting the work.

4. LOTO (Lockout/Tagout) Procedures:
   - Implement Lockout/Tagout procedures to ensure that the equipment is de-energized if possible. If complete de-energization isn't feasible, ensure partial LOTO is applied to minimize risk.
   - Verify that the equipment is de-energized using appropriate testing instruments.

5. Capacitor Discharge:
   - Before beginning repairs, ensure that all stored energy in the capacitors is safely discharged.
   - Use a discharge tool with a resistor to slowly and safely discharge the capacitor to avoid a rapid discharge that might cause damage or injury.

6. Use of Insulated Tools:
   - Only use insulated tools that are rated for the voltage level of the equipment being repaired.

7. Maintain Safe Distance:
   - Always maintain a safe distance from live components. Use barriers or insulation mats if necessary.

8. Monitoring and Assistance:
   - Always have at least one other person who is trained in electrical safety and first aid nearby in case of an emergency.

9. Documentation and Sign-offs:
   - Document all steps taken during the repair and ensure that all procedures are signed off by a competent authority.

10. Post-Repair Testing:
    - After repairs are completed, perform appropriate testing to ensure that the equipment is operating correctly and safely before fully re-energizing.
