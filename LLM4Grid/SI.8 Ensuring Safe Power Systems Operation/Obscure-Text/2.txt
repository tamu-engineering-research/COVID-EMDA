Energized Repair Work on a Capacitor Bank - Safety Procedures

1. Preparation and Planning
   - Assess the work and identify potential hazards.
   - Ensure all personnel are trained for live electrical work, aware of risks specific to capacitor banks.
   - Prepare necessary tools and personal protective equipment (PPE), including insulated gloves, face shields, arc flash clothing, and voltage-rated tools.

2. Verification
   - Verify schematics and operational configuration of the capacitor bank.
   - Ensure all safety systems and procedures are in place and functional.

3. Approach Limits
   - Establish and adhere to the appropriate approach boundaries as per NEC and OSHA guidelines.
   - Use voltage detectors to confirm the presence of voltage in the work area.

4. Performing the Repair
   - Use properly rated live-line tools.
   - Follow strict procedural protocols during the repair process.

5. Continuous Monitoring
   - Monitor the conditions of the work area and voltage levels during the repair.
   - Be prepared to abort the operation if unsafe conditions arise.

6. Completion and Documentation
   - Ensure all tools and PPE are removed from the work area after completion.
   - Document the repair work, including any adjustments or anomalies.

7. Post-Repair Testing
   - Perform functional and safety tests post-repair.
   - Monitor the capacitor bank post-repair to ensure stability and performance.

8. Review and Training
   - Review the repair execution to identify improvement areas.
   - Provide additional training based on review findings.
