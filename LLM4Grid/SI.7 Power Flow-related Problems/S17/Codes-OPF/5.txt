# Define the data
## Number of buses and generators
n_buses = 3
n_gens = 2

## Generation cost coefficients (linear cost for simplicity)
c = np.array([20, 25])  # Cost per unit of generation

## Power demand at each bus
P_d = np.array([30, 0, 20])  # Demand at each bus

## Maximum and minimum generation limits
P_max = np.array([40, 30])
P_min = np.array([10, 5])

## Admittance matrix (simplified)
B = np.array([
    [-10, 10, 0],
    [10, -20, 10],
    [0, 10, -10]
])

## Variables
P_g = cp.Variable(n_gens)  # Power generation variables
theta = cp.Variable(n_buses)  # Voltage angle variables (radians)

# Define the objective function
objective = cp.Minimize(c @ P_g)

# Define the constraints
constraints = [
    P_g >= P_min,
    P_g <= P_max,
    # Power balance equations for each bus
    B[0, :] @ theta == P_g[0] - P_d[0],
    B[1, :] @ theta == -P_d[1],  # No generation at bus 2
    B[2, :] @ theta == P_g[1] - P_d[2],
    theta[0] == 0  # Reference bus voltage angle fixed at 0
]

# Define and solve the problem
problem = cp.Problem(objective, constraints)
problem.solve()

# Output results
print("Optimal generation:", P_g.value)
print("Voltage angles:", theta.value)
