The dispatch instructions for the generators to meet the total demand at minimum cost are as follows:

Generator A: 20 MW
Generator B: 30 MW
Generator C: 70 MW
Generator D: 400 MW
These values indicate how much each generator should produce to satisfy the system's demand of 520 MW (400 MW + 80 MW + 40 MW) efficiently based on their respective marginal costs and capacity limits.
