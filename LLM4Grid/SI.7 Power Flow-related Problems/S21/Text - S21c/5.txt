Optimal Dispatch Instructions:
Generator A at Node 2: 20 MW
Generator B at Node 1: 30 MW
Generator C at Node 3: 70 MW
Generator D at Node 3: 400 MW

This configuration ensures that the demand across the nodes is met exactly and the operational cost is minimized given the constraints on each generator's capacity and cost.
