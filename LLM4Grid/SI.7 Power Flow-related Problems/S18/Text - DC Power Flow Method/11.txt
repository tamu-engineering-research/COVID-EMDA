DC Power Flow Methods Summary

1. Assumptions:
   - All bus voltages are assumed to be 1.0 per unit magnitude.
   - The transmission line resistances are negligible compared to their reactances.
   - The power factor is considered to be purely reactive, i.e., all angles are treated as zero except for the phase angle differences between buses.

2. Equations:
   - The power flow between two buses is approximated by the equation: P_ij = (θ_i - θ_j) / X_ij, where θ_i - θ_j is the difference in voltage angles between the buses and X_ij is the reactance of the line connecting them.

3. Applications:
   - Used for initial studies and quick assessments where detailed accuracy is less critical.
   - Helpful in optimization algorithms and economic dispatch calculations due to its computational efficiency.

4. Advantages:
   - Faster and less computationally intensive than full AC power flow analysis.
   - Useful for large systems where a detailed AC analysis would be too complex or slow.

5. Limitations:
   - Less accurate as it does not account for losses or voltage magnitude variations.
   - Not suitable for systems where reactive power flows and losses are significant.
